        Bob grew up around boats in Southern California while Sheila's only boating experience was riding a ferry a couple of times. We met, got married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a peniche (french barge) for a few years on the Seine river outside of Paris. This is where we got the boat building bug.

        <p>
            After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a large project - a 26-foot liveaboard sailboat. Within six months, we were living aboard LooseMoose on the Marne river east of Paris.</div>
